-- Systems combine components and other systems into larger units, and may also
-- contain channels that connect the components.
system SimpleSystem is
  PartA: ExampleComponentA;
  PartB: ExampleComponentB;
  connect PartA to PartB via RestApi;
end SimpleSystem;

system CompositeSystem is
  Frontend: SimpleSystem;
